# MongoDB Fundamentals Assignment

This assignment focuses on learning MongoDB fundamentals including setup, CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up a MongoDB database
2. Perform basic CRUD operations
3. Write advanced queries with filtering, projection, and sorting
4. Create aggregation pipelines for data analysis
5. Implement indexing for performance optimization

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom
3. Install MongoDB locally or set up a MongoDB Atlas account
4. Run the provided `insert_books.js` script to populate your database
5. Complete the tasks in the assignment document

## Files Included

- `Week1-Assignment.md`: Detailed assignment instructions
- `insert_books.js`: Script to populate your MongoDB database with sample book data

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or Atlas account)
- MongoDB Shell (mongosh) or MongoDB Compass

## Submission

Your work will be automatically submitted when you push to your GitHub Classroom repository. Make sure to:

1. Complete all tasks in the assignment
2. Add your `queries.js` file with all required MongoDB queries
3. Include a screenshot of your MongoDB database
4. Update the README.md with your specific setup instructions

## Resources

- [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/)
- [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/)
- [MongoDB Node.js Driver](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/)

## How to Run `queries.js`

To execute the MongoDB queries in the `queries.js` file, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies** (if required):  
   If your `queries.js` uses the MongoDB Node.js driver, install it by running

2. **Start your MongoDB server**:  
- For local MongoDB, ensure the MongoDB service is running.
- For Atlas, make sure your connection string is correct.

3. **Run the script**:  
In your terminal, execute:

This will connect to your MongoDB database and run the queries defined in the file.

4. **Check output**:  
The results will be displayed in your terminal.![Screenshot (194)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/782f53c7-e039-48f6-ad3d-4bd18db177c4)

> **Note:**  
> - Update the MongoDB connection URI in `queries.js` if needed (for example, to match your local or Atlas setup).
> - If you encounter connection errors, verify your MongoDB server is running and your connection string is correct.
